# Payment Initiation Service Provider

The Payment Initiation Service Provider (*PISP*) is the *Open Finance Brasil* profile authorized to perform payment initiations within the ecosystem. The Payment Initiation Service Provider will initiate consent journeys (for making payments) in participating *Open Finance Brasil* institutions that are Account Holders. This profile enables a range of new use cases, as the Payment Initiation Service Provider does not need to be the custodian of the money at any point during the transaction and also does not need to be the owner of the bank account that will settle the payment.
